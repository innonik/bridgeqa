**Manual Testing**

Checking software or programs for errors, defects, and vulnerabilities by hand from the user's perspective.

**Test Automation**

Services to optimize the testing process without delaying the release, spending budget on building a team, and false failures due to human factors.

**Managed Testing**

End-to-end customized service that enables businesses to delegate the responsibility of managing the testing process to the QA Project Manager.

**Test Documentation**

Fully support the project with all necessary QA documentation defining and specifying the required testing activities.

**Independent Testing**

To provide effective bug detection and ensure objective quality assessment, we perform independent testing. We evaluate software quality based on actual test results, having no assumptions about system operation.

**By Testing Type**

***Functional Testing***
To ensure the full functionality of the software, we check the system for compliance with functional requirements/specifications

***Perfomance Testing***
To objectively assess system operation speed, scalability, and stability, we evaluate system performance under a particular workload

***Regression Testing***
To verify whether a system operates according to the specified requirements, we confirm that a recent program or code change has not adversely affected existing features

***UX / Usability Testing***
To ensure the solution meets user expectation, we check whether a solution is user-friendly

***GUI Testing***
To prevent any user issues and negative experiences, we check the Graphical User Interface

***Compatibility Testing***
To ensure that solutions for various industries operate flawlessly under different conditions, we verify whether a solution works properly in different browsers, operating systems, networks, devices, etc.

***Localization Testing***
To verify that a solution content and user interface meet the user language and location, we evaluate products from both a linguistic and a cultural perspective

***Integration Testing***
To ensure system modules do not interfere with each other in particular combinations, we expose faults in the interaction between integrated units
